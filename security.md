# Security at Whereby

Whereby aims to provide 1 billion meaningful conversations by 2030. 
The experience of a meaningful conversation cannot exist without privacy and security. 
It's at our core as a low Total Cost of Ownership service to make sure privacy and security is handled while you and your users enjoy your meaningful conversations.


## ISO27001 Compliant

Good security requires a good foundation of policies, processes and procedures. Information Security Risk Management is at the core of Security in Whereby and the ISO27001 is the framework used to certify that we are doing it the right way.
The [ISO27001 certification for Whereby was secured in February 2022](https://whereby.com/blog/whereby-certified-with-iso-27001-certification/) can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12uzUXaz98al5HgkQvczrIRcvA2TzncYO/view?usp=sharing).

## Secure Infrastructure

Whereby is hosted on world-class globally-distributed IT infrastructure. Most infrastructure is hosted on AWS and data centers are, amongst others, SOC2 audited, ISO27001 certified and are held to the highest standards of security and uptime. 

## Encryption

Whereby uses only TLS 1.2 with a limited set of ciphers to protect data in transit. Servers have disk encryption enabled and backup data is stored in an encrypted offsite manner.

For small rooms, End2End Encryption is in effect, ensuring that nobody except the call participants, can access the video calls. For big  rooms, encrypted media in transit is decrypted only in the server memory, ensuring that the exposure of the decrypted stream is as minimal as possible.

## Data Storage and Protection

Whereby does not store your video and audio data. Period. Recordings are only stored on individual devices as the user wants to. Chat data is only stored during the meeting after which it is deleted.
